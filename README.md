# probable-pancake

Thanks for taking the to check out my exploration of Ansible, Kubernetes and React!

Step 1 -- React.

The first thing that I had to decide was what kind of Web Application I wanted to make.  I do not consider myself the most creative person, so I generated a random GitHub Repository name. I was given probable-pancake, so I figured it would be best to create a website that probably had a pancake.  Therefore, I created a website that probably contains an image of a website. However, since it is only probaly, there is always the other side of probability. 

Within this very small web app, I explored the use of UseState and React Props.  


Step 2 -- Docker. 

Next, I figured that I needed to learn to walk before I learned to run.  I installed docker, and figured out how to create a docker image to run my web application.
